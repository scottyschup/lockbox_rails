# MAC Lockbox

The MAC lockbox is a system for tracking MAC cash at partners across the Midwest. For a detailed list of app functionality, see [docs/roadmap.md](https://github.com/MidwestAccessCoalition/lockbox_rails/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md)

## Local Dev Environment

### Requirements

Technical requirements for this project. See below for step-by-step first-time setup.

| Tool       | Version  |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Ruby       | v2.6.5   |
| Bundler    | v2.1.1   |
| Rails      | 6.0.2.1  |
| PostgreSQL | v11.3    |
| Node       | v10.15.3 |

### Environment Setup

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:MidwestAccessCoalition/lockbox_rails
# Or if you don't have an SSH key setup with Github:
# git clone https://github.com/MidwestAccessCoalition/lockbox_rails.git
```

This setup assumes you are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on a Mac. For other environments, reach out to [@bintLopez](https://github.com/BintLopez) (Nicole).

#### Ruby

If you don't have a Ruby version manager, you'll want to install `rbenv`. If you already have `rbenv` or `rvm` installed, skip this step.
**DO NOT INSTALL BOTH RVM AND RBENV ON THE SAME MACHINE**.

To find out if they're already installed, in a terminal run `which rbenv rvm`. If they're both "not found" or there's no output at all, install `rbenv`.

```sh
brew install rbenv # https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv for more info
```

_If you don't have Homebrew installed, or are using a PC or Linux machine, talk to Nicole (@bintLopez) about getting your dev env setup._

To get the correct Ruby version, you can run the following from the project root to get the ruby version specified in the `.ruby-version` file.

```sh
ruby_version=$(cat .ruby-version)
ruby_version=${ruby_version#ruby-} # Remove "ruby-" if prefixed to version number
# Install Ruby via rbenv
rbenv install $ruby_version
# OR if you're using RVM
# rvm install $ruby_version
```

#### Rails

```sh
gem install bundler -v 2.1.1
bundle install # Make sure you're in the lockbox-rails root directory
```

#### PostgreSQL & DB setup

See if you have PostgreSQL:

```sh
which psql
```

If not, install and run it using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```

Setup DB:

```sh
# From project root:
bundle exec rake db:setup # runs `rake db:create db:schema:load db:seed
```

_If you have issues at this step, see this [PostgreSQL Setup](https://github.com/MidwestAccessCoalition/jane_point_oh/blob/master/docs/db_setup.md) doc. But while going through it, wherever you see the string `admin_app`, replace it with `lockbox_rails`. (This includes instances like `admin_app_development` => `lockbox_rails_development`.)_

#### Mailcatcher

```sh
# This is done outside of the Gemfile because it is an
# external tool used outside of the app environment.
gem install mailcatcher
```

#### Webpack

```sh
bundle exec rails webpacker:install
```

### Local Development

```sh
yarn dev
```
The above command will do the following:
* run the `predev` script in `package.json` which calls the bin script [`dev_setup`](./bin/dev_setup).
  * the setup script will `bundle install` and `yarn install`
* run the `dev:assets` script in `package.json` which will start `webpack` in watch mode (with a few other flags set for development purposes)
* run the `dev:rails` script in `package.json` which will start the Rails server on port 3000.

If you just need individual parts of the above, here is the manual startup process that you can tweak as needed:
```sh
# Start the dev Webpack server
yarn # if necessary
./bin/webpack --watch --colors --progress --display-error-details # or `yarn run dev:assets`
# Open a new terminal pane/tab/window
bundle install # if necessary
bundle exec rails s # or `yarn run dev:rails`
# If testing email sending functionality, start mailcatcher
mailcatcher # This will run on localhost:1080
```

#### Redis

You'll need redis for sidekiq to work

```sh
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

#### Ports in use
* 3000: Rails server
* 3035: Webpack server
* 6379: Redis server
* 1080: Mailcatcher (if applicable)

### Security Scans
We use several automated scans to check for known vulnerabilities both in our code
and our dependencies. To run all of the scans at one time:
```sh
yarn scan:all
```

There are also scripts that can be run for each individual scan or grouped by language
(see `package.json > scripts` for more specifics). Every scan is configured to automatically
print its output to the terminal as well as a log file in the `tmp/security-scans`
directory. These scans are integrated as part of the CI build-and-test process.

Note that some of the scans can find issues that are not severe enough to be considered
`errors` but should still be attended to. Brakeman especially highlights low, moderate,
and high level `warnings` that may need to be addressed to ensure the highest level
of AppSec confidence.

#### Brakeman
We use Brakeman to check for security vulnerabilities in our project's codebase.
This check runs in CircleCI and any output from the scan is saved in the Artifacts
tab under `security-scans/brakeman.log`. Brakeman can also be run locally:
```sh
yarn scan:brakeman
```

For more control over the process, you can also run `brakeman` manually from the 
terminal to get more detailed output or to ignore for lower-level warnings, in which case 
[Brakeman's usage options](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/blob/master/OPTIONS.md)
may be useful.

#### Bundler Audit
We use `bundler-audit` to check for security vulnerabilities in our project's gem dependencies.
This check runs in CircleCI and any output from the scan is saved in the Artifacts
tab under `security-scans/bundler-audit.log`. `bundler-audit` can also be run locally:
```sh
yarn scan:bundler-audit
```

Any non-critical vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed immediately can be temporarily
ignored by adding the CVE ID to the root-level `.bundler-audit.ignore` file.

#### `lockfile-check`
This is a custom script that ensures `yarn` and `bundle` have both been run
successfully and that `npm i` has not also been run. To run locally:
```sh
yarn scan:lockfiles
```

#### Snyk
Snyk is simmilar to `bundler-audit` except that it checks our project's Javascript
package dependencies for vulnerabilities. To run locally:
```sh
yarn scan:snyk
```
